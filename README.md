# Frontend-learning-v2

It's my second course about HTML and CSS. This time the author is <em>SuperSimpleDev</em> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc).
In my opinion it's a very good course for begginers, there are a lot of excercises after every lesson!!! I did every assignment of course (ok, maybe 95% XD).
